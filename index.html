                    <h2>ARYABHATA</h2>
                    <p>
                        The introduction of Aryabhata to the world happened through his remarkable work in the field of mathematics and astronomy. Aryabhata is one of the most renowned Indian Mathematicians, in fact, one of the firsts. Born in the Gupta era that is during the rule of the Gupta Dynasty in 475 CE in Kusumapura, Pataliputra, he was known for his extraordinary knowledge in the astronomical field. He has written many treaties in both mathematics and astronomy. He was also the author of many mathematical books which to date is considered holy and reverend immensely. Many of his works were lost, but some are still available for modern scholars and hold great credibility. And his inventions, discoveries and contributions have brought pride to our country. The contributions of a scientist since Aryabhata has never been the same. He truly made the world notice India, in terms of holding scientific knowledge and value that made a difference to the world. It has also inspired many budding scientists to follow his path and make discoveries. He challenged and contradicted many beliefs that were going on at the time and through calculations provided pieces of evidence for it to be true. And after all these years, his work does not flinch from meticulous accuracy.

                        <p>Aryabhata’s birthplace is uncertain, but it may have been in the area known in ancient texts as Ashmaka, which may have been Maharashtra or Dhaka or in Kusumapura in present day Patna.
                        Some archaeological evidence suggests that he came from the present day Kodungallur, the historical capital city of Thiruvanchikkulam of ancient Kerala - this theory is strengthened by the several commentaries on him having come from Kerala.
                        He went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time. Both Hindu and Buddhist traditions, as well as Bhāskara I, the 7th Century mathematician, identify Kusumapura as modern Patna.</p>

                                    Aryabhata’s major work, Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was extensively referred to in the Indian mathematical literature, and has survived to modern times. The Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, and trigonometry.

                                    Direct details of his work are known only from the Aryabhatiya. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it Ashmakatantra (or the treatise from the Ashmaka).It consists of 108 verses and 13 introductory verses.
                                </p>

                                    The Aryabhatiya is also occasionally referred to as Arya-shatas-aShTa (literally, Aryabhata’s 108), because there are 108 verses in the text. It also has 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four pādas or chapters.
                                </p>

                                    He worked on the approximation for pi thus — add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000, the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.

                                    His contribution to the study of Algebra is immense. In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes through well tried formulae.

                                    He correctly believed that the earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth, challenging the prevailing view.

                                    He correctly deduced that the orbits of the planets are ellipses; this is another great discovery not credited to him but to Johannes Kepler (a German astronomer, born AD 1571).
